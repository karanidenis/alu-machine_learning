Calculus for machine learning
=============================
## Introduction
Calculus is the study of change. It provides a framework for modeling systems in which there is change, and a way to deduce the predictions of such models. 

## Functions

## Derivatives
The derivative of a function $f(x)$ is defined as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at point $x$.

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$


## Integrals
The integral of a function $f(x)$ is defined as the area under the curve of the function between $x=a$ and $x=b$.

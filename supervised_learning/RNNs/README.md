### RNNS
RNNs - Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network that is designed to handle sequential data. They are called recurrent because they perform the same task for every element of a sequence, with the output being dependent on the previous computations. RNNs have a "memory" which captures information about what has been calculated so far. This memory allows RNNs to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. 

RNNs are used in a variety of applications such as:
- Language modeling and generation
- Machine translation
- Speech recognition
- Image captioning
- Time series prediction


### Types of RNNs
1. **One to One**: This is the standard feedforward neural network. It takes an input, feeds it through a series of layers, and produces an output.
2. **One to Many**: This type of RNN takes a single input and produces a sequence of outputs. An example of this is music generation.
3. **Many to One**: This type of RNN takes a sequence of inputs and produces a single output. An example of this is sentiment analysis.
4. **Many to Many**: This type of RNN takes a sequence of inputs and produces a sequence of outputs. An example of this is machine translation.
